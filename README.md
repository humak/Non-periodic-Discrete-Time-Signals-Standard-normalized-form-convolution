# non_periodic_discrete_time_signals_and_-standard_normalized_form

functionA.py
visualizes two non-periodic discrete time signals by entering their amplitude values 
with respect to sampling numbers within the predefined boundaries.

functionB.py
calculates and draws standard normalized form of the signals

functionC.py
calculates convolution of the signals

functionD.py
calculates convolution of standard normalized forms of the signals
